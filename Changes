	* distro cleanups after moving from CVS to SVN

	* updated copyright and license info

1.16 - 2006-11-17

	should have been a conditional test

1.13 - 2006-06-23
	* Improved caching that uses DBM::Deep if available
	* Added fetch_oui_from_cache, so you can avoid the network
	if you really don't want to use it

	from the network (and not from cache)
	* fetch_oui now comprises those two functions, trying the
	cache first

	* Load any oui.txt source that you like (another URL or local
	file://)

1.01 - 2006-05-25
	* The last release forgot to bump the version number. There's no
	need to upgrade since this only fixes a missing MANIFEST.

	* MANIFEST was missing from diff. I've fixed that.

0.24 - 2006-05-20

	tests to write

0.1 - 2004-08-31
	* first pass, a bit of a monster that grew out of a simple
	script.
